Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling Missing Values:

Missing values in critical columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked were addressed:
The Age column was imputed with its median value, ensuring that outliers did not overly influence the imputation.
Missing Cabin values were replaced with the mode (most frequent value).
Rows with missing Embarked values were dropped for simplicity.

Outlier Detection and Removal:

Outliers in numerical data (e.g., Age) were identified using the interquartile range (IQR) method:
First Quartile (Q1) and Third Quartile (Q3) were computed.
IQR = Q3 - Q1 was calculated, and any values beyond 1.5 * IQR from Q1 or Q3 were removed.
This ensured the data retained a cleaner distribution without extreme values.

Step 2: Visualizing Categorical Variables

A series of bar graphs provided insights into categorical variables:
Passenger Gender Distribution:
A bar graph revealed that male passengers significantly outnumbered female passengers on board.
Survival Analysis:
A second bar graph showed that more passengers died than survived, highlighting the tragedy of the Titanic incident.

Class Distribution:

The third visualization depicted the distribution of passengers across ticket classes. Most passengers traveled in the third class, indicating affordability and its correlation with survival chances.
Embarkation Points:
Another bar graph illustrated that the majority of passengers embarked from Southampton, showcasing its role as a major boarding point.

Step 3: Age Distribution and Statistical Analysis

Age Distribution:
A frequency distribution plot of Age revealed that most passengers were between 20 and 30. This age group constituted the largest demographic on board.
Statistical Summary:
Key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical data were analyzed using the describe() function, providing an overview of central tendencies and variability.

Step 4: Correlation and Relationships

Correlation Analysis:
The relationships between numerical variables were examined using the correlation matrix (corr()) and visualized with a heatmap. The heatmap highlighted notable correlations, such as the association between Fare and Pclass.
Insights from the Heatmap:
The stronger relationships between certain variables, such as Fare and Survived, suggest that wealthier passengers had a higher likelihood of survival.

Final Notes

This analysis uncovered key trends, distributions, and relationships, providing valuable insights into the Titanic dataset. The approach included systematic cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration, ensuring accuracy and clarity in the results.

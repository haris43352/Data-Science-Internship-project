 Fraud Detection System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Fraud Detection System. The system is designed to detect fraudulent activities using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models. The project showcases techniques to analyze transactional data and identify potentially fraudulent cases.

 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features from raw data to enhance model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluating algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or any other specified models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.

 Files

- `_Task 3 Fraud Detection System.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the fraud detection workflow.
- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding and running the project.

 Workflow

1. Load Dataset:

Load the transactional dataset and analyze it.

2. Data Preprocessing: 
Handle missing values, outliers, and scale numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering:
Generate new features that help in distinguishing fraudulent transactions.

4. Model Training: 
Train machine learning models to detect fraud.

5. Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.

6. Results Visualization:
Visualize important features and model predictions.

 Example Output

Include a summary of results, such as model precision, recall, and F1-score achieved during evaluation:


Precision: 0.95
Recall: 0.90
F1-Score: 0.92
ROC-AUC: 0.96
